# About Me

Hello! My name is Iman Malik and I am a Statistics & Data Science major at the University of Texas at Austin. I am also pursuing a minor in Business along with the Programming and Computation certificate. I have a strong foundation in Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn), R, SQL, and Excel, with which I can analyze, visualize, and manipulate data. I use these skills to build predictive models and interpret complex trends, and I am looking forward to applying them to real-world opportunities to gain industry experience!

Check out my Movie Recommendation project, in which I used Python libraries to analyze, wrangle, and interpret big data and real user data to build an interactive search engine and recommendation system for movies, implemented as a widget within Jupyter Notebook.

My Tech Layoffs Analysis is a project where I used SQL to clean and standardize a real big dataset, which I then used to perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and insights within global tech layoff data.

My Bike Sales Dashboard contains a visualization dashboard I created in Excel utilizing pivot tables after cleaning a dataset of bike sales across the world.

Check out my Titanic project, where I used Python libraries for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, preprocessing, and data analysis to build a prediction model.

My Incarceration Records analysis is a class project I completed in which I used R for cleaning, wrangling, and analyzing a real big data set to interpret relationships and complex trends. I produced my report using R markdown. Additionally, I created a Shiny app where the user can interact with multiple variables.
