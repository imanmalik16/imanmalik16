# About me

Hello! My name is Iman Malik and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a Statistics & Data Science major, and I am pursuing a minor in Business along with the Elements of Computing certificate. I have a strong foundation in data analysis, data wrangling, mathematics, Python, R, and SQL.

Check out my Titanic prediction model, where I used Python libraries for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, preprocessing, and data analysis. I also used a Naive Bayes model implementation.

My Incarceration Records analysis is a class project I completed in which I used R for cleaning, wrangling, and analyzing a dataset. I produced my report using R markdown. Additionally, I created a Shiny app where the user can interact with multiple variables.
